# Advanced Analytics - Power BI Projects  

## Problem 1: University Admissions Data Transformation  

### Problem Statement
Analyze the trend of admissions into state universities in the USA by performing data transformations and modeling using Power BI.  

### Objective
Perform data transformations to clean, shape, and model the admissions data for visualization and dashboard creation.  

## Use Case
Design a dashboard to analyze trends in university admissions across different states and student demographics.  

### Source
- USA State University Admissions dataset  

## Analytics Performed
Using **Power Query Editor** in Power BI, the following transformations were applied:  
1. **Append Data**: Combine multiple datasets for comprehensive analysis.  
2. **Split Data**: Separate columns into meaningful components.  
3. **Column Formatting**: Standardize column names and data types.  
4. **Fill Columns**: Handle missing values for consistent datasets.  
5. **Transpose Table**: Convert rows to columns for reshaping.  
6. **Pivot / Unpivot**: Reshape the data to suit analysis needs.  
7. **Merge Join**: Combine tables based on common keys.  
8. **Conditional Columns**: Create new columns based on logic or thresholds.  
9. **Index Columns**: Add unique identifiers to rows.  
10. **Summary Tables**: Generate aggregated tables for reporting.  

### Outcome
A cleaned and well-modeled dataset ready for advanced visualizations and dashboard creation.  

## Key Learnings
- Learned to perform multiple types of data transformations in Power BI.  
- Gained experience in shaping raw data for analytical purposes.  
- Developed skills in handling missing values and combining datasets.  
- Improved ability to structure data for interactive dashboards.

## Problem Conclusion
This problem demonstrates how raw admissions data can be transformed using Power BI’s Query Editor to create a clean, structured, and actionable dataset for dashboard reporting and trend analysis.

## Problem 2: University Admissions Advanced Visualizations  

### Problem Statement
Design a dashboard to visualize and analyze the trend of university admissions, highlighting distribution by state, race, and funding.  

### Objective
Use advanced Power BI visualizations, expressions, and filters to provide actionable insights on admissions data. 

## Use Case
Design a comprehensive dashboard for analyzing applications and university trends to support decision-making by administrators and analysts.

### Source
- USA State University Admissions dataset  

## Analytics Performed
Using Power BI and DAX expressions:
- **Applications Analysis Dashboard**
  1. Total Applications vs. Target Trend by State
  2. Total Applications by State using Geo Map
  3. Tabular presentation of universities and allocated funds
  4. Percentage of Applications by Race
- **Universities Analysis Dashboard**
  1. Top 10 Universities by Applications
  2. Top 10 Universities by Applications with and without Special Grants
  3. Bottom 10 Universities by Applications
  4. Percentage of Applications vs. University Fund Allocations

### Outcome
Interactive dashboards displaying admissions trends, top/bottom performing universities, and fund allocation insights. 

## Key Learnings
- Gained expertise in DAX expressions and custom visualizations.
- Learned to create dashboards combining tabular, geo, and graphical insights.
- Improved skills in analyzing trends across multiple dimensions.
- Learned to present insights for strategic decision-making.

## Problem Conclusion
The project demonstrates advanced visualization techniques in Power BI to analyze university admissions trends, identify top universities, and evaluate fund allocations effectively.

## Problem 3: Superstore Shipping Costs Analysis  

### Problem Statement
Identify potential **shipping cost leakages** in Superstore sales using top-down and bottom-up analysis.  

## Use Case
Provide insights into shipping cost patterns across order priorities, shipping modes, and customers, enabling management to identify inefficiencies and reduce costs.

### Source
- Superstore Sales Dataset  

## Analytics Performed
- **Top-Down Analysis**
  1. Shipping Costs by Order Priority – Bar Chart
  2. Shipping Costs by Shipping Mode – Funnel Chart
  3. Shipping Costs by Customers – Scatter Plot
  4. Transactional view of underlying data for detailed inspection

- **Bottom-Up Analysis**
  1. Duplicate above dashboard
  2. Change interactions for bottom-up exploration
  3. Replace Transactional View, Donut, and Scatter Plots with Tree Map for hierarchical insight 

### Outcome
A set of dashboards enabling detailed analysis of shipping costs, identifying outliers, and providing actionable insights for cost optimization.  

## Key Learnings
- Gained hands-on experience with top-down and bottom-up BI approaches.
- Learned to combine multiple visualizations for anomaly detection.
- Improved ability to identify business inefficiencies using Power BI.
- Developed insights for actionable decision-making in logistics and operations.

## Problem Conclusion
The project demonstrates the use of Power BI for analyzing Superstore shipping costs, applying both top-down and bottom-up perspectives to identify cost leakages and improve operational efficiency.

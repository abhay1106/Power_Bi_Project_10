# Advanced Analytics - Power BI Projects  

## Problem 1: University Admissions Data Transformation  

### Problem Statement
Analyze the trend of admissions into state universities in the USA by performing data transformations and modeling using Power BI.  

### Objective
Perform data transformations to clean, shape, and model the admissions data for visualization and dashboard creation.  

### Source
- USA State University Admissions dataset  

### Analytics Performed
Using **Power Query Editor**, the following transformations were applied:  
1. Append Data from multiple sources.  
2. Split Data into meaningful columns.  
3. Column Formatting to ensure consistency.  
4. Fill Columns to handle missing values.  
5. Transpose Table for pivoting rows to columns.  
6. Pivot / Unpivot to reshape data.  
7. Merge Join to combine datasets.  
8. Create Conditional Columns for categorization.  
9. Add Index Columns for unique identification.  
10. Generate Summary Tables for analysis.  

### Outcome
A cleaned and well-modeled dataset ready for advanced visualizations and dashboard creation.

## Problem 2: University Admissions Advanced Visualizations  

### Problem Statement
Design a dashboard to visualize and analyze the trend of university admissions, highlighting distribution by state, race, and funding.  

### Objective
Use advanced Power BI visualizations, expressions, and filters to provide actionable insights on admissions data.  

### Source
- USA State University Admissions dataset  

### Analytics and Visualizations
**Applications Analysis Dashboard**:  
1. Total Applications vs Target Trend by State (Line/Column Chart).  
2. Total Applications by State (Geo Map).  
3. Tabular presentation of universities and allocated funds.  
4. Percentage of Applications by Race (Pie/Donut Charts).  

**Universities Analysis Dashboard**:  
1. Top 10 Universities by Applications.  
2. Top 10 Universities by Applications with/without Special Grants.  
3. Bottom 10 Universities by Applications.  
4. Percentage of Applications vs University Fund Allocations.  

### Outcome
Interactive dashboards displaying admissions trends, top/bottom performing universities, and fund allocation insights.

## Problem 3: Superstore Shipping Costs Analysis  

### Problem Statement
Identify potential **shipping cost leakages** in Superstore sales using top-down and bottom-up analysis.  

### Use Case
Perform top-down and bottom-up visual analysis to detect outliers and cost inefficiencies in shipping.  

### Source
- Superstore Sales Dataset  

### Analytics and Visualizations
**Top-Down Analysis**:  
1. Shipping Costs by Order Priority (Bar Chart).  
2. Shipping Costs by Shipping Mode (Funnel Chart).  
3. Shipping Costs by Customers (Scatter Plot).  
4. Transactional view of underlying data.  

**Bottom-Up Analysis**:  
1. Duplicate the top-down dashboard and modify interactions.  
2. Replace transactional view, donut, and scatter plots with a Tree Map for detailed bottom-up insights.  

### Outcome
A set of dashboards enabling detailed analysis of shipping costs, identifying outliers, and providing actionable insights for cost optimization.  

## Key Learnings
- Mastered data transformation and modeling using **Power Query Editor**.  
- Gained expertise in creating **advanced Power BI visualizations** and dashboards.  
- Learned **top-down and bottom-up analytical approaches** for cost leakage identification.  
- Improved ability to handle large datasets and perform interactive data analysis.  
- Learned to design dashboards for **decision-making and performance monitoring**.  

## Conclusion
These projects demonstrate the use of Power BI for transforming raw data into actionable insights. From university admissions trends to shipping cost optimization, the dashboards provide clear visualizations, interactivity, and analytics to support data-driven decision-making.
